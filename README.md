Secure Utility Suite:
A minimalist collection of utilities written in Python with Tkinter has two independent GUI programs: a secure password generator and a live digital clock. The password generator enables users to create several strong, random passwords of different lengths from a given set of letters, numbers, and special charactersâ€”perfect to fortify account security. The digital clock, conversely, shows the system time in real time in a clean interface that changes every second, making it a handy and visually appealing desktop gadget. Both programs combined demonstrate the successful application of GUI design, randomness, and live system functionality in Python.
